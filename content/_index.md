I'm Nader; a software engineer, entrepreneur, published academic and conference speaker. I'm passionate about building good 
software and products that help to improve people's lives. I firmly believe technology should be built for the benefit 
of society and the people who use it and I take a keen interest in the relationship we have with technology.
 
I use my experience, knowledge and insights into product development, business operations, processes and practice to 
help organisations get the most out of technology. I work with people to build great products, achieve their goals and 
make their organisation become more effective.
