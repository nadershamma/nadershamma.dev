I run a small non profit beverage company in the UK with my partner. I was trying to better understand how I can make 
better use of the web, both in terms of website improvements and social media use, to market our product and promote 
our brand. I had tried seeking out advice and went on a course but was left bewildered by jargon. I just wanted someone 
to give me clear guidance. Nader took the time to look over the current status of our web presence. He sat with me and 
clearly explained what my options are and gave me some clear recommendations on how and where I should focus our 
efforts. By the end of the session I had a much better understanding of how to begin to improve my website, how to 
focus my social media efforts and how to start to think about building and structuring my content to promote the story 
of our brand. I would recommend working with him.
