We are a small company that has been growing steadily over the last few years in the food manufacturing and 
distribution sector. As part of our growth we have been looking to further increase our online sales, website structure 
and optimisation. Basically to grow our online presence and ensure the site satisfied its main purpose. We found this 
to be time consuming and a minefield of information and contradictions from one information source to another. We 
turned to Nader based on another businesses recommendation and he offered a 30 minute phone consultation to discuss our 
current site, what was working and where work was needed. This was clearly structured and detailed information. We then 
commissioned him to complete a full site audit based on speed, optimisations and some SEO. Nader completed these 
promptly and produced a detailed report highlighting key areas to work on. We met to talk through the report which was 
really helpful and allowed us to take notes and focus on key areas to develop. Whilst the work required was time 
consuming, having the knowledge of what was needed to improve the site from a professional was a great advantage. We 
have since updated the site, with a new front page, updated recipe sections, optimisation throughout the site and have 
noticed increased traffic based on this, sales are starting to increase as well. We would highly recommend Nader to 
anyone who is wanting to make sure they have done everything they can to ensure their site is optimised, has clear 
structure and understand what Google is doing to make your site available to customers.
