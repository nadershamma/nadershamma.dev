Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have shown great promise in the field of medicine and healthcare. 
This talk outlines the findings from research which seeks to understand how AI and ML have been applied to the realm of 
patient care within the context of chronic disease, with a specific focus on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). 

First we present an overview of IBD, highlighting the nature of the disease and some of the challenges the various 
stakeholders face within the framework of outpatient care. Then we outline the current state of research into the 
application of AI and ML in general clinical care and in relation to IBD. 

After which we explore how both AI and ML have been utilized to help with the outpatient treatment of chronic illnesses 
which share similar challenges to that of IBD, such as Diabetes, mental health conditions and Parkinson's disease, so as 
to gain precedent into how similar techniques may be used to assist in IBD outpatient support. Finally, we discuss the 
work that has passed and explore the prospect of future research into the field.
