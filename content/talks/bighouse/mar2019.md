Stories matter. How often have you heard marketing gurus espouse the virtue of crafting your organisation’s Brand Story 
or, to pay careful attention to your Customer’s Journey?

In this workshop, we go beyond the buzz words. Using simple narrative design techniques, utilised by the game industry 
to craft great player experiences, you will learn how to apply these techniques within your business to create great 
stories that help you engage with stakeholders; be they customers, employees, investors and more.

This is the first in a series of workshops introducing gamification; the art of utilising game-based mechanics in 
non-gaming environments, helping businesses and organisation better engage with their stakeholders.

## WHO IS IT FOR?

Creative & Digital entrepreneurs, start-ups & SMEs who need to be inspired & engage with stakeholders.
