Organisations, of many sizes, often find themselves needing to educate a variety of people. Perhaps you need to teach 
your employees to comply with regulation or educate customers on how you operate. You may simply want to seek novel 
ways to share your knowledge and teach others.

Games have the ability to influence the way people think, encouraging them to consider a particular perspective or 
explore new concepts.

In this workshop we will walk through some simple introductory examples of how games can be used to teach people a 
variety of subjects. Using simple game design techniques, you will learn how engaging content can help people learn 
new topics and concepts.

This is the second in a series of workshops introducing gamification; the art of utilising game-based mechanics in 
non-gaming environments, helping businesses and organisation better engage with their stakeholders.

## WHO IS IT FOR?

Creative & Digital entrepreneurs, start-ups & SMEs who need to be inspired & engage with stakeholders.
