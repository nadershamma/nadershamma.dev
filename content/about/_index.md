I am a software engineer, business consultant, published academic and public speaker, specializing in full stack web 
development. I have experience managing projects across the entire software development life cycle, and work in an 
agile way to deliver a product thatâ€™s built for the user not just the device.

At present I work as a software engineer at [Mitrefinch Ltd](https://www.mitrefinch.co.uk/), building a suit of 
innovative workforce management systems. I also work as a consultant helping businesses get the most out of technology 
and entrepreneurs develop of new software products.
